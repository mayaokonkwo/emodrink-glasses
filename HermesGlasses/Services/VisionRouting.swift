// VisionRouting.swift
//
// Which eye a session uses, as pure logic. Foundation only, so it
// unit-tests standalone with swiftc like DwellTracker.
//
// This exists because the first cut got the question wrong. It asked "are
// glasses PAIRED" (`registrationState == .registered && !devices.isEmpty`)
// when the question is "can a glasses session be CREATED". Glasses that are
// paired but out of range answer yes to the first and no to the second, so
// Auto never fell back and Start listening
// took the glasses path and failed with `noEligibleDevice`.
//
// The caller now passes eligibility straight from the SDK's own selector
// (`AutoDeviceSelector.activeDevice != nil`) - the very thing
// `createSession` resolves - and the rules below are the only interpretation
// layered on top.
