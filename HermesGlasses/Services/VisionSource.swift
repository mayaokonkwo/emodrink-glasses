// The one seam between "what Hermes sees" and which hardware it comes
// from. Five features use a camera - visual queries, "remember this
// person", conversation capture, the Lens screen, and the Photo test - and
// all five talk to this protocol, so phone mode reaches every one of them
// without a single `if phoneMode` branch at a call site.
//
// Frames arrive already reduced to what the app actually consumes: a
// UIImage to draw and a CVPixelBuffer to run vision on. That conversion used
// to live in LensViewModel; doing it here means the DAT SDK's VideoFrame
// type stops at this boundary.
