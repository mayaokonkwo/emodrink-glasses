// HermesApp.swift
//
// What a Hermes "app" is, as data.
//
// Lens, People, Map and Log were each written by hand, and they turned out
// to be the same thing four times over: a voice trigger, a set of hardware
// capabilities, a lens surface, a phone surface, a store under Application
// Support, and usually an export. This describes that shape so the drawer,
// the "What can I say?" page, and any future app all read from one list
// instead of three hand-maintained ones.
//
// Deliberately NOT a plugin runtime. It carries no views and no closures -
// wiring a screen needs the view models, and that belongs in the view
// layer. Keeping this a value type is what makes it Foundation-only and
// testable, and it is the piece a fifth app will push on first.
//
